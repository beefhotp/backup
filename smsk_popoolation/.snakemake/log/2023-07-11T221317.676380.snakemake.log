all
clean
decompress
fst
    Make every plot
fst_merge
fst_plot
    Plot pairwise F_ST distributions over a genome
fst_sliding
    Compute sliding F_STs in one chromosome.

    Note: fst-sliding requires a true file
fst_split_table
    Split fst table into a pair
hp
hp_plot_population
    Plot the genome-wide H_p distribution of a population
hp_table_population_chromosome
    Build the hp table for a population in a chromosome.
index_bam
    Index a bam file
index_cram
    Index a .cram file
index_fasta
    Index a .fasta
map
map_bwa_index
    Index with bwa
map_bwa_map
    Map population with bowtie2, sort with samtools, compress to cram
map_filter
    Remove duplicates from CRAM and filter out sequences.

    samtools view | MarkDuplicates | samtools view -f -F | SortSam
    samtools view

    Pairs with something unpaired will disappear.
map_split
    Extract chromosome in cram

    We use uncompressed bam to accelerate the output. The result of this rule
    is temporary.

    Note: the following step is picard MarkDuplicates, and needs a proper file
    since it makes two passes. Output is a bam because MarkDuplicates needs
    one.
mpileup
mpileup_convert
    Compute the mpileup and compress it
mpileup_popoolation_filter_indels
    Filter indels from an mpileup given a GTF files with their coordinates.
    Compress results.

    Both fifo and fifo.gz will be deleted.
mpileup_popoolation_identify_indels
    Get a GTF with the indels present.
mpileup_popoolation_subsample
    Perform the subsampling step. Compress results as they are generated
    through a FIFO
popoolation
popoolation_d
popoolation_merge_snps
    Merge snps
popoolation_merge_variance_sliding
    Merge results across chromosomes
popoolation_pi
popoolation_plot
    Plot a genome-wide result's from variance sliding
popoolation_theta
popoolation_variance_sliding
    Run popoolation's Variance sliding script: Tajima's D, Tajima's Theta or Pi
qc
qc_trimmomatic
    Run trimmomatic on paired end mode

    to eliminate Illumina adaptors andremove low quality regions and reads.

    Inputs _1 and _2 are piped through gzip/pigz.
    Outputs _1 and _2 are piped to gzip/pigz (level 9).
    Outputs _3 and _4 are compressed with the builtin compressor from
    Trimmomatic.

    Further on they are catted and compressed with gzip/pigz (level 1).
    Sequences will be stored permanently later on on CRAM
raw_extract_genome
    Extract the fasta.gz on config.yaml into genome.fa
raw_make_links_pe
    Make a link to the original file, with a prettier name than default
reports
reports_fastqc
reports_samtools_flagstat
reports_samtools_idxstats
reports_samtools_stats
sync
sync_compress
sync_filter_indels
    Filter indels from the joint mpileup
sync_identify_indels
    Identify indels like in mpileup_popoolation_identify_indels, but all
    together
sync_mpileup2sync
    Convert joint mpileup to sync

    - mpileup2sync returns error always, and that is why there is a || true.
    - Next step requires a proper file
sync_subsample
    Subsample a sync file.

    Note: A proper file is required as input and output.
